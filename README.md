Experimental graphics
=====================

This repository is an absolute mess. Part of the Infinite Print project, all the generative graphics algorithms on FunkyVector are available here. It's a long way from professional code; it is 'experimental' after all. This code is hardly 'business class code' and does not adhere to the normal [rules](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9168-programs-must-be-written-for-people-to-read-and-only) of code. Since there is no I in 'team', but 5 in 'individually brilliant', for most of the time this code is only viewed by myself and executed by FunkyVector. Finished experiments run in a browser (client) and in node (server).

It is also occasionally viewable on [raurir.github.io](http://raurir.github.io/)

Today I decided that I need to make my experimental artwork more accessible to myself primarily, and in the process make the code more accessible to others.

Experimental and generative art involves rapid tweaking of the idea; constants, variables and functions mutate on the fly towards an unclear vision. This often leads to messy code, bizarre mathematics, uncommented oddities and dysfunctional `/* commented out */` blocks. Perhaps in the process of putting this code in the public sphere extra effort will be engaged to make this work presentable.
